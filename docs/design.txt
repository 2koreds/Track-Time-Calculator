Problem Statement:
A program is required to ask users to input how many track events they participate in. Based on how many track events the user enters (1-4), the program must then
ask the user for each event name (Ex: 800m, 400m, 200m, et cetera) and their best time in that event. From the given information, the program must calculate how much time the
user needs to take off from their best time in order to qualify for state. If the user's given time does qualify, display "Congratulations! Your time is fast enough to qualify for state!"
Once calculated, display the user's given event,  time, the approximate time required to qualify for state, and the difference between the two.

Example Display:
Your event: 400m
Fastest time: 53.6 seconds
State Qualification time: ~52.8 seconds
Time needed to drop: .8 seconds

You need to drop approximately .8 seconds from your 400m time in order to qualify for state! Good luck!


Nouns and Verbs.

Nouns: users, track events, track events, user, program, user, event name, best time in event, information, program, user, best time, state, users given time, users given event,
time, approximate time, difference between times

Verbs: ask users to input, user enters, ask user for event name and best time, calculate users best time against state qualification time, if user qualifies display a congratulations message,
if user does not qualify display given event, time, approx time for state, difference between the two.


Defining Diagram:

Inputs: Amount of events, what event, best time (in order)

Processes: Calculate the difference between user best time and state qualification. If faster then qualification: Display congratulations message.
           If slower then the state time: Display user time, user event, state qualification time, and the difference between the two.

Outputs: ALWAYS output user event, user time, state qualification time. If qualified display congratulations your time is fast enough to qualify.
         If not fast enough, display the difference between the state qualification time and user time with a good luck message.
